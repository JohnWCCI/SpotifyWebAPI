#Consuming a Web API

##Step 1. Setup Spotify as a Developer
Go to https://developer.spotify.com/

Login (or create a new user)
Go to Dashboard
Create an app

Save the ClientID and the Client Secret (The App Settings is a good place)

Use this later Authication....
 "Spotify": {
    "Clientid": "ID",
    "ClientSecret": "Secret"
  }

##Step 2. Start the Application

  Build a New "ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)"
  Name it "SpotifyWebAPI"

  Add Authication to the Appsettings.json

  Add a folder "Services"
